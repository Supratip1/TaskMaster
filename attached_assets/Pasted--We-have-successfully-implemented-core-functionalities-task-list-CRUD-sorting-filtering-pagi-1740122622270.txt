💡 "We have successfully implemented core functionalities (task list, CRUD, sorting, filtering, pagination). Now, let's complete the remaining milestones, ensuring best practices, accessibility, and UX refinements."

🔴 DO NOTs (Strict Rules - Must Follow)
❌ No External Backend – Persist data using localStorage, do not use an external database.
❌ No AI-Generated Full Components – Code must be modular, structured, and manually written.
❌ No Table Libraries – Sorting, filtering, pagination must remain manually implemented.
❌ No Poor Accessibility Practices – Ensure full keyboard support, ARIA roles, and high contrast UI.

📌 Milestone 5: Local Persistence (Save Tasks to LocalStorage)
1️⃣ Implement Persistent Data Storage
✅ Ensure tasks are saved to localStorage after every CRUD operation.
✅ On app load, retrieve tasks from localStorage and update the state.
✅ If localStorage is empty, initialize with an empty array or mock data.

2️⃣ Handle Edge Cases
✅ If a task is deleted, ensure it is also removed from localStorage.
✅ If data becomes corrupted (e.g., invalid JSON), reset storage and show an error message.

✅ UX Considerations:

Show a loading indicator when retrieving tasks.
Display a toast notification ("Task saved!" or "Task deleted!") for better feedback.
📌 Milestone 6: Dynamic Custom Fields
3️⃣ Add Custom Field Editor
✅ Users should be able to add/remove custom fields dynamically.
✅ Allowed field types:

Text (string input)
Number (numeric input)
Checkbox (boolean toggle)
✅ Provide an "Add Custom Field" button inside settings/modal.
4️⃣ Store Custom Fields in LocalStorage
✅ When a new field is added, update all tasks with that field (default to empty).
✅ Ensure removing a field updates all tasks and doesn’t break existing functionality.

5️⃣ Display Custom Fields in Task Table
✅ Once added, the custom fields should appear as new table columns.
✅ Ensure sorting/filtering works with custom fields.

✅ UX Considerations:

Prevent users from adding duplicate field names.
Ensure empty custom fields show placeholders (e.g., "—").
🎯 Next Steps After Core Milestones (Bonus Features)
After Milestones 5-6, we will implement bonus features to improve UX and add advanced functionality.

📌 Milestone 7: Animations & Transitions
✅ Add smooth fade-in/fade-out animations for task additions & deletions.
✅ Ensure modals and dropdowns have soft transitions for better UX.

📌 Milestone 8: Undo/Redo Functionality
✅ Implement an Undo button to reverse the last action (add, delete, edit).
✅ Implement Redo functionality to restore the undone action.
✅ Store undo/redo history in state (up to the last 10 actions).

📌 Milestone 9: Bulk Actions
✅ Add checkbox selection for multiple tasks.
✅ Enable bulk delete with a confirmation dialog.
✅ Implement bulk edit (e.g., change status for all selected tasks).

📌 Milestone 10: Kanban View
✅ Add Kanban board layout (columns for "Todo," "In Progress," "Done").
✅ Enable drag-and-drop reordering of tasks within columns.
✅ Ensure Kanban updates persist in localStorage.
